# Code Examples for Peeking under the hood: low level visibility inAndroid with eBPF
 
This repository contains the code and build scripts used in my talk, [Talk Title]. It includes all the examples and demos I walk through during the session, along with the necessary scripts to build and run them. You can use this repository to follow along or revisit the examples after the talk.

To build the examples just run the `build_all.sh` script (docker is required to set up the environment).
At the end of the compilation the examples can be found in `build/`
