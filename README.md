# Code Examples from Peeking under the hood: low level visibility inAndroid with eBPF
 
This repository contains the code and build scripts used in my talk _Peeking under the hood: low level visibility inAndroid with eBPF_. It includes all the examples and demos I walk through during the session, along with the necessary scripts to build and run them. You can use this repository to follow along or revisit the examples after the talk.

**Disclaimer**: This code has been developed for demo purposes, chance are it is full with bugs so 
please refrain from using it in anything close to production :D 


To build the examples just run the `build_all.sh` script (docker is required to set up the environment).
At the end of the compilation the examples can be found in `build/`
